              I’m a software developer with a specialty in JavaScript and Python.
              My software development career grew from a curiosity of wanting to
              learn about penetration testing. I quickly found myself staying up
              late, reading everything I could find to get a better understanding
              of the subject. I soon realized that any legit penetration tester
              was writing their own code to achieve the goals they were seeking.
              Fast forward to today and that curiosity has turned into a passion
              for software development!

          I am really grateful to have had the pleasure of working with such a diverse type of organizations, 
          from household brands and public institutions to startups with a dream to change the world. Here's a 
          little bit about them and what we've done together to give you a sense of what I can do.

            Developed an iternal tool using Javascript to automate the export of data 
            from the fast field form application to an adobe PDF form. This helps the

            Using Greater Givings CMS, I developed the silent auction website for Atlanta 
            Classical Academys Annual silent auction. I set up the website to collect registration 
            and take payments using TLS encryption. I used tools like HTML5, CSS3, & Javascript
            to set up the UI/UX of the site. Not only did I set up the website, I also set up the network 
            infrastructure the night of the event. With my help, we were able to double the proceeds that 
            the school raised the previous year totaling over $100,000.

            Working at Chick-fil-A HELP, I developed all types of scripts and web apps using programming languages like:
            Python, Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, & Bootstrap just to name a few. My task ranged from developing a way
            to help streamline the S.O.P flowcharts using a web app to automating daily task that analyst had to use everyday. I 
            worked along side a team of 5 in an agile environment while working here.
