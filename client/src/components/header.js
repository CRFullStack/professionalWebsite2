                Iâ€™m a software developer with a specialty in JavaScript and
                Python. My software development career grew from a curiosity of
                wanting to learn about penetration testing. I quickly found
                myself staying up late, reading everything I could to get a
                better understanding of the subject. I soon realized that any
                legit penetration tester was writing their own code to achieve
                the goals they were seeking. Fast forward to today and that
                curiosity has turned into a passion for software development!
